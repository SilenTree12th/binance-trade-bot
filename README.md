> Automated cryptocurrency trading bot

## Why?

This project was inspired by the observation that all cryptocurrencies pretty much behave in the same way. When one spikes, they all spike, and when one takes a dive, they all do. _Pretty much_. Moreover, all coins follow Bitcoin's lead; the difference is their phase offset.

So, if coins are basically oscillating with respect to each other, it seems smart to trade the rising coin for the falling coin, and then trade back when the ratio is reversed.

## How?

The trading is done in the Binance market platform, which of course, does not have markets for every altcoin pair. The workaround for this is to use a bridge currency that will complement missing pairs. The default bridge currency is Tether (USDT), which is stable by design and compatible with nearly every coin on the platform.

<p align="center">
  Coin A → USDT → Coin B
</p>

The way the bot takes advantage of the observed behaviour is to always downgrade from the "strong" coin to the "weak" coin, under the assumption that at some point the tables will turn. It will then return to the original coin, ultimately holding more of it than it did originally. This is done while taking into consideration the trading fees.

<div align="center">
  <p><b>Coin A</b> → USDT → Coin B</p>
  <p>Coin B → USDT → Coin C</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>Coin C → USDT → <b>Coin A</b></p>
</div>

The bot jumps between a configured set of coins on the condition that it does not return to a coin unless it is profitable in respect to the amount held last. This means that we will never end up having less of a certain coin. The risk is that one of the coins may freefall relative to the others all of a sudden, attracting our reverse greedy algorithm.

## Binance Setup

-   Create a [Binance account](https://accounts.binance.me/en/register?ref=139017085) (Includes my referral link, I'll be super grateful if you use it).
-   Enable Two-factor Authentication.
-   Create a new API key and whitelist your IP for it.
-   Get a cryptocurrency. If its symbol is not in the default list, add it.

## Tool Setup

### Required Python version

Currently Python 3.7 is the minimum required version.

### Install Python dependencies

Run the following line in the terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Create user configuration

Create a .cfg file named `user.cfg` based off `.user.cfg.example`, then add your API keys and current coin.

**The configuration file consists of the following fields:**

-   **api_key** - Binance API key generated in the Binance account setup stage.
-   **api_secret_key** - Binance secret key generated in the Binance account setup stage.
-   **current_coin** - This is your starting coin of choice. This should be one of the coins from your supported coin list. If you want to start from your bridge currency, leave this field empty - the bot will select a random coin from your supported coin list and buy it.
-   **bridge** - Your bridge currency of choice. Notice that different bridges will allow different sets of supported coins. For example, there may be a Binance particular-coin/USDT pair but no particular-coin/BUSD pair.
-   **tld** - 'com' or 'us', depending on your region. Default is 'com'.
-   **hourToKeepScoutHistory** - Controls how many hours of scouting values are kept in the database. After the amount of time specified has passed, the information will be deleted.
-   **use_margin** - 'yes' to use scout_margin. 'no' to use scout_multiplier.
-   **scout_multiplier** - Controls the value by which the difference between the current state of coin ratios and previous state of ratios is multiplied. For bigger values, the bot will wait for bigger margins to arrive before making a trade.
-   **scout_margin** - Minimum percentage coin gain per trade. 0.8 translates to a scout multiplier of 5 at 0.1% fee.
-   **trade_fee** - Controls trade fee for calculating profitable jumps. By default it doesn't have value: gets values through the binance api calls. Otherwise use float values for the fee. [Binance fee table for reference](https://www.binance.com/en/fee/schedule)
-   **strategy** - The trading strategy to use. See [`binance_trade_bot/strategies`](binance_trade_bot/strategies/README.md) for more information
-   **enable_paper_trading** - (`True` or `False` default `False`) run bot with virtual wallet to check its performance without risking any money.
-   **buy_timeout/sell_timeout** - Controls how many minutes to wait before cancelling a limit order (buy/sell) and returning to "scout" mode. 0 means that the order will never be cancelled prematurely.
-   **scout_sleep_time** - Controls how many seconds bot should wait between analysis of current prices. Since the bot now operates on websockets this value should be set to something low (like 1), the reasons to set it above 1 are when you observe high CPU usage by bot or you got api errors about requests weight limit.
-   **buy_order_type** - Controls the type of placed buy orders, types available: market, limit (default=limit)
-   **sell_order_type** - Controls the type of placed sell orders, types available: market, limit (default=market)
-   **buy_max_price_change/sell_max_price_change** - Controls how much price change in decimal percentage is accepted between calculation of ratios and trading.
-   **price_type** - Controls the type of prices used by the bot, types available: orderbook, ticker (default=orderbook). Please note that using the orderbook prices increase the CPU usage.
-   **accept_losses** - Needs to be set to true for highly risky and gamling strategies. Otherwise the bot wont start.
-   **auto_adjust_bnb_balance** - Controls the bot to auto buy BNB while there is no enough BNB balance in your account, to get the benifits of using BNB to pay the commisions. Default is false. Effective if you have enabled to [use BNB to pay for any fees on the Binance platform](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/115000583311-Using-BNB-to-Pay-for-Fees), reade more information [here](#paying-fees-with-bnb).
-   **auto_adjust_bnb_balance_rate** - The multiplying power of buying quantity of BNB compares to evaluated comission of the coming order, effective only if auto_adjust_bnb_balance is true. Default value is 3.
-   **allow_coin_merge** - Allow multiple_coins strategy to merge coins into one. It turned out that its more profitable if the strategy can merge the held coins into one. If you dont want this you may be safer for one falling coin but you also pay with potential gains. Default is true to ensure the behavior is like in the origin repo.

#### Environment Variables

All of the options provided in `user.cfg` can also be configured using environment variables.

```
CURRENT_COIN_SYMBOL:
SUPPORTED_COIN_LIST: "XLM TRX ICX EOS IOTA ONT QTUM ETC ADA XMR DASH NEO ATOM DOGE VET BAT OMG BTT"

```

### Paying Fees with BNB
You can [use BNB to pay for any fees on the Binance platform](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/115000583311-Using-BNB-to-Pay-for-Fees), which will reduce all fees by 25%. In order to support this benefit, the bot will always perform the following operations:
-   Automatically detect that you have BNB fee payment enabled.
-   Make sure that you have enough BNB in your account to pay the fee of the inspected trade.
-   Take into consideration the discount when calculating the trade threshold.

### Notifications with Apprise

Apprise allows the bot to send notifications to all of the most popular notification services available such as: Telegram, Discord, Slack, Amazon SNS, Gotify, etc.

To set this up you need to create a apprise.yml file in the config directory.

There is an example version of this file to get you started.

If you are interested in running a Telegram bot, more information can be found at [Telegram's official documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots).

### Run

```shell
python -m binance_trade_bot
```

## Docker

Please remember that this is a fork. To maintain the security of your API key it relies on local builds.

### Build and run locally
1. Clone this git to a location of your choice: 
`git clone https://github.com/tntwist/binance-trade-bot tntwist-binance-trade-bot`
2. Change to the directory:
`cd tntwist-binance-trade-bot`
3. Build the container locally (this may take a few minutes depending on your hardware):
`docker build . -t tntwist-binance-trade-bot`
4. Follow the steps in [Create user configuration](#create-user-configuration) to ensure you have created a `user.cfg` file in the directory created in step 2. If you have already done this, continue to step 5. 
5. Run docker-compose up
`docker-compose up`

To update, repeat steps 1 through 5. These commands can also be added to a shell script to automate the process.

### If you only want to start the SQLite browser

```shell
docker-compose up -d sqlitebrowser
```

## Backtesting

You can test the bot on historic data to see how it performs.

```shell
python backtest.py
```

Feel free to modify that file to test and compare different settings and time periods

## Database warmup

You can warmup your database with coins wich you might want to add later to your supported coin list. 
This should prevent uncontrolled jumps when you add a new coin to your supported coin list.

After the execution you should wait one or two trades of the bot before adding any new coin to your list.

By running the script without parameters, it will warm up the bots default database with all available coins for the bridge.

```shell
python3 database_warmup.py
```

If you want to specify a separate db file you can use the -d or --dbfile parameter.
If not provided, the script will use the bots default db file.

```shell
python3 database_warmup.py -d data/warmup.db
```

You can also specify the coins you want to warmup with the -c or --coinlist parameter.
If not provided the script will warmup all coins available for the bridge.

```shell
python3 database_warmup.py -c 'ADA BTC ETH LTC'
```

## Developing

To make sure your code is properly formatted before making a pull request,
remember to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/):

```shell
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The scouting algorithm is unlikely to be changed. If you'd like to contribute an alternative
method, [add a new strategy](binance_trade_bot/strategies/README.md).
